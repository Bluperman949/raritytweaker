<h1>Rarity Tweaker</h1>
<p>Rarity Tweaker is a client-side minecraft mod that allows the user to override the rarity of items via config.</p>
<p>You know how some items have yellow, blue, or purple names? Those are "rarities", and they're called <code>UNCOMMON</code>, <code>RARE</code>, and <code>EPIC</code> respectively.
I feel like there are some pretty rare items with white names, and with RPG mods that highlight rare items, you'd want to show them off with a fancy color.</p>

<h2>Disclaimers & Notices:</h2>
<p>This mod is only available for Fabric at the moment. I'll port it to forge if enough people ask for it.</p>
<p>Feel free to use Rarity Tweaker in your modpack.</p>
<p>I don't have a discord server or forum yet. You can find me in most of the big mod dev servers as <code>@bluperman949</code>. Feel free to DM.</p>

<h2>How to use:</h2>
<p>Open <code>.minecraft/config/raritytweaker-rarities.txt</code>.</p>
<p><code>minecraft:diamond UNCOMMON</code> will make diamonds' names yellow.</p>
<p><code>minecraft:netherite_ingot</code> and <code>netherite_ingot</code> will both affect the Netherite Ingot item. The <code>minecraft:</code> namespace is optional, but other namespaces are not.</p>
<p><code>#this will be ignored.</code></p>
<p><code>*netherite</code> will affect all items whose IDs contain the string "netherite".</p>
